        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND JAVASCRIPT
        -->
        
        <p>
            this week, Sarverio assigned us to made a project freely with at least 1 input and 1 output device each. I don’t have any idea at first. So , I take several components of the circuit, which I consider to be useful in my project design.
Lying on my bed, I found I get used to waking up late in the weekend morning, which is quite a waste of time,  how can I sleep more than 8 hours in a nice day like that. Additionally ,our fencing tutor once encouraged us to practice fencing and defending, with  the sun rising.make this scene into a movie, that will be meaningful.
‘May be I need a alarm ringing when the sun rises’ I said to myself and at that time I have already planned to make it out with a photosensitive resistance and an active buzzer.
‘goolge it’ whenever I meet whatever I don’t understand, my head remembers  Sarverio inspired us with a smile. However ,my computer science skills are  limited, which troubled me a lot .the hardest barrier is that I don’t know the vale of the photosensitive resistance.  
Fortunately ,Leo came to my help , he instructed me to understand the logic of C++code first then connected the photosensitive resistance alone to the arduino software. Writing a line of code to print the changing  unknown vale by the monitor will  make it easy to set a threshold without a muti-meter. 
And at last my alarm clock works .more improvement are suggested to be  done such as , control the voice of the buzzer and make a box for the device.
 it is a  freshman’s project ,rough and ugly but it means something .i will remember the tiny project till my last day.
