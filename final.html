        <!--
            MADE WITH <3 AND JAVASCRIPT
        -->
        
        <p>
            my friend once complained to me that he always felt bored when coding and he wanna a potted landscape but he doesn't have time to water it.his words inspired me to make this artifical flower.
1:This is my final project:
My friend complain to me that he always feet bored when coding and he loves flowers.
However he didn’t have time to water a potted landscape. So I wanna make a fake flower for him.

2:Above the flower , I add an emoji to it.

3:Here comes my circuit diagram. It’s hand draw on my ipad.
The red represent photosensitive resistances. If you cast more light on it , the value of resistance is going down.
            
4:Here comes my product processing
            
5:Because the bread board id too big and also too ugly. So I used welding skills to connect each elements.

6: My creative teacher，Saverio ，conceived the idea of placing the circuit in a cube of 10cm*10cm*10cm and helped me design a rough sketch of the cube. And I print it out with the laser cutter.

7:What I learnt during the 12-week course?
I can design 2D or 3D models un Rhino/ Soildworks and then print them out .
I can run the laser cutter and 3D printer
I can print a circuit and maybe design a basic circuit with Arduino.

8:Here comes the demo
What can it do?
First ,it’s a decoration on your desk. 
Second，in original design ,it can follow the sunlight like a sunflower.
However, I reset the function of my flower and now it can know which side of the cube has more light , if there is more light on the left ,the rose will turn left.
Additionally, putting an emoji/ postcard/ your GF’s imagines on the rose will definitely relearn your stress and improve your coding rates.
